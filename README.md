This repository provides a script enabling R to search multiple labelled datasets for topics of interest

Programming language: R

R packages: haven, dplyr, downloader, tidyr

The script in this repository allows the user to search single or multiple labelled dataframes in R for terms of interest present in the variable names, (head of) variable contents, variable labels and value labels. To demonstrate application of this search method, the script in this repository first imports publicly available data from Uwezo (https://www.twaweza.org/go/uwezo-datasets) before manipulating all labelled (Stata-format) datasets into a single dataframe for searching, xx_clean. The dataframe, xx_clean, is then searched for all terms in a search string, called search_string. 

The user can substitute the datasets in dfs_list and dfs_conc for any other datasets (up to 8 in total). Similarly, the terms in search_string can be substituted to all those of interest to the user. 

Users should be aware that information in the var_name column of xx_clean features the original variable name prefixed with the name of the dataset in which it is found and the string '_var_'.
